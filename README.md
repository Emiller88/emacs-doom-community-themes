## Getting Started

If you're using this with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)
you just need to clone this repo into your `.doom.d`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Emiller88/emacs-doom-community-themes ~/.doom.d/themes
```

Or you can add it as a submodule

```shell
cd ~/.config/doom
git submodule add https://github.com/Emiller88/emacs-doom-community-themes themes
```

Melpa package is coming soon!
